Goal: To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

Analysis:
As with previous labs you can tell SQL to order the database with the ' order by..' statement:
' order by 1-- >> this time it results with a 500 error due to possibly not liking one of the characters used
' order by 1# >> the # character can also be used as comment - this time returns a 200 response
After further probing with the 'order by' by statement - we find that the page is using two columns

Since we know from the lab its MySQL & Microsoft we can refer to the correct syntax to query the database version

' union select null, @@version# >> gives the version: 8.0.23
