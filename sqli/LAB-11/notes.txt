Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

Vulnerable parameter >> tracking cookie

Goals:
1) Enumerate password of admin
2) Log in as admin

Analysis
 ---------
When testing for Blind SQL the first step is to force a TRUE/FALSE use case to see how to application responds. If there is a difference in response you can
then figure out how to exploit the web app. For this lab we are going to focus on using the tracking ID to trigger a TRUE/FALSE USE case.

1.  Confirm that the parameter is vulnerable to Blind SQL
select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingid = 'wj6FkJCkmttewQap'
-> if this tracking id exists -> query returns value -> 'Welcome Back' message
-> if doesnt exist -> no 'Welcome Back' message
