Lab1: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

Goal: perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.

Analysis:
--------

Reflected XSS is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way. 

To test for this we need to inject an alert statement to see if the application responds with the JS alert.

1. Inject alert statement into search bar 
    <script>alert(1)</script> --> triggers alert(1), the app is vulnerable to reflected XSS
