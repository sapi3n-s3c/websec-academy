Lab2: Reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search functionality but uses a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common XSS vectors.

Goal: Perform a cross-site scripting attack that bypasses the WAF and calls the print() function.
